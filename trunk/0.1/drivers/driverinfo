 Info about SQL Drivers
========================
Drivers are classes that allow for connection to different sql server types.
Instead of building a direct port over for a different SQL server,
the only thing someone needs to do is either create a different driver OR use a pre-created driver.
The driver's class is a non-inherited class and is only created for the use of assetr.

=====================================
 Using a SQL Server Driver in assetr
=====================================
    This is a two-fold process. First, determine if you have the appropriate driver
for your SQL server. Make sure that driver is in the drivers subdirectory, and it has the naming
convention SQLDRIVERTYPE.driver.php (e.g. mysql.driver.php is the mysql driver). Next in
the config.php file, make sure to set the $config['sql']['driver'] variable to SQLDRIVERTYPE (e.g.
you would set it to mysql to use that driver). That is it. assetr will then use that driver to connect to the database.

==================================
 HOWTO Create A Driver for assetr
==================================
    Since there are different functions for different SQL servers, we need to have a simpler, more common
code set that can let assetr do the basic sql commands and still get the same results every time. The driver
is the backbone between the sql server and assetr. So, while assetr will pass the same query everytime,
the driver is supposed to help assetr interpret it.

Things to keep in mind:
    - Each driver is a class (titled sqldriver) that must be created in it's own appropriate sql driver file.
    - Each driver must conform to the functions below.
    - The driver must NOT conflict with assetr in any way. It is meant to be a go between from the SQL server and assetr.
    - All the functions in the class are public.
    
PsuedoCode Below:

class sqldriver
    protected variable connectioninfo
    public variable queryresult
    
    function connect(sqlserver, sqlusername, sqlpassword, sqldatabase)
        // Code to connect here
    
    function query(query)
        // Code to accept query here
    
    function array(queryresult)
        // Code to make the query result in to an array
    
    function numberrows(queryresult)
        // Code to show how many number of rows are returned in an query.
    
    function error()
        // Code to help spit out the error
    
    
More will be added based on the continuation of programming assetr.
